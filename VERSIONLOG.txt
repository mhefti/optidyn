VERSIONLOG


optimization_v00
- 1 experiments, just adsorption mode to be fitted
- lsq, MultiStart, GlobalSearch
- Brutus compatible
- parellel eval of objective function in optimizer


optimization_v00.1
- any number of experiments to be fitted
- adsorption/desorption mode possible


optimization_v01
- added patternsearch and restructured getfit

optimization_v02
- normalized the variables to be fitted
- normalized also experimental data (see optimfcn_sa)
- give time for jobs as input
- added interpolating function interp1 to account for non regular time steps in the experiments 
  (not always 1 second as specified)
- added fminsearchbnd as option
- corrected the flow in get_experiments
- changed the objective function, now every experiments is equally weighted
	-> note: obviously leads to changes in the value of the objective function, careful when comparing



optimization_v03
- added option for equilibrium theory fitting   
  
  
TO DO: 
- equilibrium theory fitting -> put in version 3
- fitting options for detailed model (Lisa/Dorian)
- decide what happens with the value of the function value when there is an error or a timeout
